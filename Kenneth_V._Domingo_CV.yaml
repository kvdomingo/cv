            Led a cross-functional team of 7 engineers to architect and develop the UNICEF 
            [Giga DataOps Platform](https://sync.giga.global), a fully 
            [open-source](https://github.com/unicef/giga-dagster) master data management platform
            built in coordination with [Giga](https://giga.global), a UNICEF-ITU joint initiative whose mission is
            to connect all schools to the internet by 2030. V1.0 of the Platform was launched in September 2024 and 
            was presented at the 
            [Open Source Summit](https://osseu2024.sched.com/event/1iSnq/global-school-connectivity-dataops-platform-shilpa-arora-unicef) 
            in Vienna later that month. At launch, the Platform managed data for over 2.1M school records across 141 
            countries, with near-real-time connectivity data for 93k schools updating every few minutes. The Platform 
            was also being leveraged by 2 downstream applications with 5k monthly users.
